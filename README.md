# Project Hatchway

Customers want to take advantage of container technology for running stateful, data intensive applications such as databases and modern cloud native applications. One of the significant barriers they face is the lack of out-of-the box persistent storage solution in the container eco-system since it requires building a robust, elastic, and programmable storage infrastructure with same level of security, data integrity, high availability, and storage services that are expected in a modern IT infrastructure.

Project Hatchway address this gap in vSphere environments by offering storage infrastructure choices for container environments, from hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) powered by VMware vSANâ„¢ to traditional SAN and NAS storage.

Project Hatchway offers tighter integration with container orchestrators such as Docker Swarm and Kubernetes to meet needs of DevOps community. It enables developers to consume storage infrastructure as code with freedom to choose the orchestrator of their choice abstracting complexity of underlying storage infrastructure. In addition, through Project Hatchway, data services such as snapshot, cloning, encryption, de-duplication, compression etc. are available at a container volume granularity. It empowers admins with visibility into storage to efficiently enforce SLAs and QoS through Storage Policy Based Management (SPBM). Container storage is carved out of proven VM storage, providing all of the enterprise capabilities and storage services already available for VM storage. This combination of container schedulers and vSphere storage delivers a complete solution for stateful applications.
